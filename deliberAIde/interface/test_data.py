        'Participant 1: "The role of social media in political campaigns is a subject that has gained significant attention in recent years. \
            It has become a powerful tool for politicians to engage with voters and spread their message. \
            However, there are concerns about the spread of misinformation and the manipulation of public opinion through targeted ads." \
            Participant 2: "I agree that social media provides a platform for political candidates to connect with a wider audience and mobilize support. \
            However, the lack of regulation and transparency in political advertising on these platforms is a major issue that needs to be addressed." \
            Participant 3: "I believe that social media has democratized political discourse and allowed marginalized voices to be heard. \
            It provides a platform for grassroots movements and enables citizens to participate in political discussions like never before.\
            We should focus on educating users about media literacy and critical thinking to combat misinformation." \
            Participant 4: "While social media has its benefits, the algorithms used by these platforms tend to create echo chambers and reinforce existing biases. \
            We need better regulation to ensure that diverse viewpoints are represented and to prevent the manipulation of public opinion through targeted content."', 
    'Revamping annual festival': 
        'Participant 1: "Our annual festival needs a revamp. The last one didn\'t pull in the crowds." \
            Participant 2: "Yeah, we can incorporate more local talent, add a stage for local bands." \
            Participant 3: "And more food stalls. Our region is known for its cuisine, we can showcase that." Participant 4: "Festivals are a great place to promote local crafts too. We have a rich tradition here." \
            Participant 5: "We should also think about sustainability. We can minimize waste and promote recycling." \
            Participant 6: "What about partnering with local businesses? They can sponsor the event." \
            Participant 7: "And we can organize workshops and competitions for kids. Involving families is important."\
            Participant 8: "Finally, we need to get the word out. A stronger marketing strategy maybe?" \
            Participant 9: "How about reaching out to local influencers? They can promote the event on social media." \
            Participant 10: "It seems we all agree then. More local flavor, sustainability, business partnerships, family activities, and better marketing. Shall we start drafting the plan?"'}
