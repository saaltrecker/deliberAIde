It has become a powerful tool for politicians to engage with voters and spread their message. However, there are concerns about the spread of misinformation and the manipulation of public opinion through targeted ads.\" Participant 2: \"I agree that social media provides a platform for political candidates to connect with a wider audience and mobilize support. However, the lack of regulation and transparency in political advertising on these platforms is a major issue that needs to be addressed.\" Participant 3: \"I believe that social media has democratized political discourse and allowed marginalized voices to be heard. It provides a platform for grassroots movements and enables citizens to participate in political discussions like never before. We should focus on educating users about media literacy and critical thinking to combat misinformation.\" Participant 4: \"While social media has its benefits, the algorithms used by these platforms tend to create echo chambers and reinforce existing biases. We need better regulation to ensure that diverse viewpoints are represented and to prevent the manipulation of public opinion through targeted content.\"\n",

We need more and affordable homes.\" Participant 6: \"The environment! We can't ignore the impact of population growth on nature.\" Participant 7: \"What about promoting family planning programs?
