    "    Step 2: If there is only one viewpoint, summarize the viewpoint in 3 keywords max,\n",
    "                more keywords only if necessary to fully grasp the viewpoint. Viewpoint keywords\n",
    "                should be expressed as noun phrases that describe the viewpoint in a depersonalized manner.\n",
    "                For example, instead of “Supports Renewables”, the viewpoint keyword should be “Support for Renewables”.\n",
    "                Instead of “Believes in Traditional Energy”, the viewpoint keyword should be “Belief in Traditional Energy”.\n",

    "                the viewpoint in a depersonalized manner, as explained in the instruction for one viewpoint.\n",
    "    Step 3: Disregard viewpoints that are not relevant to the current topic or more relevant to another topic. Only if a viewpoint is equally relevant to multiple topics, include it under all relevant topics.\n",
    "    Step 4: Identify any linkages between viewpoints that build upon each other or propose solutions to identified issues. For instance, if a viewpoint such as 'Media literacy and critical thinking' is expressed as a solution to the issue identified in another viewpoint like 'Concerns about misinformation', classify it as a sub-viewpoint of the latter. Represent these sub-viewpoints appropriately within the hierarchical structure of the result dictionary.\n",
    "    Step 5: Identify viewpoints that convey essentially the same stance on the topic. For example, viewpoints like 'Lack of regulation and transparency' and 'Need for better regulation' express similar concerns regarding the need for increased regulation in the domain. In such cases, merge these viewpoints into a single unified viewpoint that encapsulates both perspectives. Ensure this is reflected in the summary of viewpoints in the result dictionary.\n",

    "               It is often structured as follows: a claim backed up with evidence, facts, and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Step 3: Summarize all the arguments per viewpoint or sub-viewpoint in one or multiple sentences.Make the summary long enough to capture the full complexity of the argument and make it understandable for an outsider unfamiliar with the discussion, but shorter than the corresponding discussion excerpt. Arguments should be expressed as noun phrases that describe the argument in a depersonalized manner.\n",

    "                - For each viewpoint and sub-viewpoint, insert a new sub-dictionary with all the argument summaries in support of the respective viewpoint or sub-viewpoint. Format the dictionary in JSON-format.\n",

    "Maria: \"Folks, our school district has been in the news for rising dropout rates, and our budget surplus is rapidly depleting. We need to brainstorm ideas to tackle this problem. Your thoughts?\" Jonas: \"From what I've seen in my teaching experience, interactive learning strategies work wonders in keeping students engaged. VR tech can play a significant role here, don't you think?\" Elise: \"Indeed, Jonas, the immersion and interactivity of VR could drive higher engagement. But we also need to factor in costs - VR tech isn't cheap. We might have to consider crowdfunding or approaching tech companies for donations.\" George: \"Fair point, Elise. But we need to consider the possibility of widening the digital divide - not all students have the same access to technology at home. Also, the cost of maintenance could be high.\" Maria: \"All valid points. But how about starting with a pilot project in one of the schools? We can measure its success and then decide whether to scale it up or not.\"\n",
    "P1: \"The debate around the legalization of recreational marijuana has been a hot topic recently. I personally think it's high time we embraced this change. It could be a new source of tax revenue and reduce crime related to illegal drug trafficking.\" P2: \"I agree with the economic benefits, P1, but aren't we forgetting about the public health implications? Increased accessibility might lead to misuse and addiction. I'm worried about our youth.\" P3: \"The public health concern is valid, P2. But, alcohol and tobacco are legal and potentially harmful too, isn't it a matter of personal responsibility and proper regulation?\" P4: \"P3 makes a good point. Regulation is the key. Maybe we can use some of the tax revenue for public health campaigns and addiction treatment services?\" P5: \"And let's not forget, legalization also means we can have quality control standards for marijuana, which isn't possible now. It might actually make it safer.\" P6: \"True, but there's also the image issue. We don't want to be seen as a city promoting drug use, do we?\" P7: \"It's a tricky decision indeed. Maybe we should hold a citywide referendum and let our citizens decide? In the meantime, we should gather more data and engage experts in public health, law enforcement and economic policy to ensure we have all the facts.\"\n",
