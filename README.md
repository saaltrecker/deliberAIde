## Description

__deliberAIde__ is a deliberation assistant for situations where one wishes to promote more inclusive and effective decision-making. The initial prototype, developed over 1 week, utilizes GPT-4 and prompt-engineering in handling a discussion transcript and performing topic, argument, and viewpoint analysis. It utilizes Flask API and a very simple HTML/JS/CSS UI to display the summarization results into a mermaid minmap.

We intend to continue further developing deliberAIde over the coming months, to include features such as real-time audio transcription, improved data visualization, conflict analysis, and more intuitive UI/UX.

### Why deliberAIde?

Data indicates a decline in inclusiveness and equal participation in political processes in democratic countries. Deliberative democracy formats like citizen assemblies have been gaining popularity as a solution, but still face barriers to inclusivity, participation, and consensus-building. This is where deliberAIde comes in. deliberAIde's mission is to create as an AI-powered tool to assist moderation and participation within deliberative decision-making processes like citizen assemblies, in order to empower inclusive and effective policy decisions. It closes remaining gaps through real-time transcription, translation, language simplification and visualization so everyone can engage, while AI-powered conflict analysis enhances mutual understanding and consensus-building. By enabling efficient information processing and facilitating comprehension, deliberAIde strengthens inclusion, equal participation and effective conflict resolution in deliberative forums. 

Our goal as a non-profit democracy-tech company is to make participatory decision-making more inclusive, effective, and sustainable. Although conceptualized for deliberative assemblies, deliberAIde's application is wider, from business to civil society. deliberAIde ensures all voices are heard for truly equal and inclusive decisions - from corporate board rooms to community town halls.
